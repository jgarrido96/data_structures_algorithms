# Task 1: Message Storage and Retrieval

# Distributed Hast Tables (DHT) seem to be one of the quickest ways to store massive amounts of data.
# Similar to trees, DHTs have slow latency, retrieving data quickly compared to other forms of data storage.


# Task 2: Real-Time Updates

# Once more, DHTs seem to be the best for real-time updates.
# Able to retrieve data quickly, even when there are large swaths of data is invaluable for live/real-time updates.


# Task 3: Conversation List Management
# A great way to store data is linked lists. You can store massive swaths of data that is quickly and efficiently referenced
